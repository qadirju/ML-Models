# Text Processing with Deep Neural Network

This project demonstrates text processing using a Deep Neural Network (DNN). It includes preprocessing steps with a Tokenizer and leverages neural networks for text analysis and modeling.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, cleaning, and preparation of text data.
- **Deep Neural Network**: Implementation of a DNN for text processing tasks.
- **Tokenizer**: Efficient text tokenization for input preparation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-Models.git
    cd "Text Processing with Deep Neural Network"
    ```

2. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

3. Run the preprocessing script:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```

4. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

5. Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```
